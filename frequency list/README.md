# HOW TO USE
It load the txt file in the code and gives you a frequency list of words.
It numbers and special characters are not part of the list.

# PURPOSE
Give an ordered frequency list of words in a text.
I was learning how to work with files.
So I thought it would be nice to do something like this.

# NOTE
- I didn't test it enough.
- You cannot see unless you print each statement line by line, but it generate a strange "code-word".
I strongly believe it has to do with the encoding, but it is not a big deal because it get removed from the list,
so the script works fine anyway. (of course I need to fix it somehow)
## further study/improvement:
1) understand how character encoding works on python
2) the output should be saved on a file
3) figure out a way to actually visualize the data in a simple way for now
