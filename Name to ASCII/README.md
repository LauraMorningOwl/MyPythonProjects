# PURPOSE
It has no purpose.
I did it to apply a bit of Tkinter concepts on something.

# NOTE
- I believe the name of this script is a lie. It returns also unicode characters.
The good thing is that it supports also Japanese or Chinese.
- Clicking Enter on the keyboard doesn't work yet.
## further study:
1) understand how character encoding works on python
2) study Tkinker more - but first learn OOP very well or building GUI, in general, would be a pain
